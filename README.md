# üé• LAN Audio & Video Streaming App

> A cross-platform Python desktop application that captures microphone and webcam input from one machine (server) and streams it in real-time to another machine (client) over TCP on port 443.

---

## üìå Purpose

The goal is to enable secure and reliable audio-video streaming across machines within the same LAN, even when the client device is behind a strict firewall that blocks most incoming connections. By streaming over TCP port 443, we ensure high compatibility with restrictive network environments.

## üéØ Goals

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] Capture webcam video from the server using OpenCV
- [ ] Capture microphone audio from the server using `sounddevice`
- [ ] Stream audio and video to a client over TCP on port 443
- [ ] Display video in a GUI window on the client
- [ ] Play audio in real-time on the client

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Add GUI controls for connecting/disconnecting, status, and volume
- [ ] Compress and decompress audio/video for lower latency
- [ ] Add basic encryption (SSL or symmetric encryption)
- [ ] Multi-client support

### Personal Learning Goals
- [ ] Deepen understanding of socket programming and audio/video encoding
- [ ] Gain experience with cross-platform GUI development (e.g. PyQt, Dear PyGui)
- [ ] Improve concurrency handling using `threading` or `asyncio`

## üë• Target Users

- Users who want to set up temporary video/audio feeds over LAN without installing heavy tools
- Developers or hackers looking for a custom, tweakable streaming solution
- Environments with strict firewalls or limited network permissions

## üß† Notes & Ideas

- Frame encoding with `cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame)` for smaller packet sizes
- Audio buffering may require careful tuning to prevent lag/choppiness
- Consider sending control messages via a separate port or using message headers
- Eventually support UDP fallback for low-latency environments
- Option to stream audio-only or video-only
